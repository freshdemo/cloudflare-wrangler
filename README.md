# Cloudflare Wrangler Container
#
#
# Wrangler is a cli tool to interact with Cloudflare Workers serverless platform
# at the edge.
#
#
# This container automates a bit of the deployment by installing Rust,
# setting the environment variable, and installing wrangler in case
# you want to move from machine to machine and delete environments 
# like me.
